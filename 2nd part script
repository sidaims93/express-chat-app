1. Setup SocketIO with the server instance to listen to real-time events.

2. When User logs in 
    - mark last_login in user record
    - subscribe to two channels -
        - one for listening to server-wide notifications
        - one for listening to incoming messages
        - add listener to keyboard typing event to send to recipient's web window (`typing .....`) under their username.
        - add logic for sending message (Backend API).
        - emit notification for recipient's window for the recipient to see the message in real time.
    
3. When user logs out, 
    - mark last_logout timestamp in the user record
    - emit offline notification for the app-wide channel (so that everyone sees the user log out)
    - recipient's window should also offline if the user's conversation is open.
    
4. When user selects a user from the frontend 
    - subscribe to the recipient's socketio channel.
    - Add null check for the message input.
